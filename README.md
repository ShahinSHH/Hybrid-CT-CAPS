# Hybrid-CT-CAPS

The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has been remarkably impacting
the world and influencing a broad aspect of people’s lives
since its first emergence in late 2019. The highly contagious nature
of the COVID-19 has raised the necessity of developing deep
learning-based diagnostic tools to identify the infected cases in the
early stages. Recently, we proposed a fully-automated framework
based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the CT-CAPS, to distinguish
COVID-19 infection from normal and Community Acquired
Pneumonia (CAP) cases using chest Computed Tomography (CT)
scans. Although CT scans can provide a comprehensive illustration
of the lung abnormalities, COVID-19 lung manifestations highly
overlap with the CAP findings making their identification challenging
even for experienced radiologists. Here, the CT-CAPS is
augmented with a wide range of clinical/demographic data, including
patients’ gender, age, weight and symptoms. More specifically,
we propose a hybrid deep learning model that utilizes both clinical/
demographic data and CT scans to classify COVID-19 and
non-COVID cases using a Random Forest Classifier. The proposed
hybrid model specifies the most important predictive factors increasing
the explainability of the model. The experimental results
show that the proposed hybrid model improves the CT-CAPS performance,
achieving accuracy of 90.8%, sensitivity of 94:.% and
specificity of 86.0%.
